## 🔍 Key Contributions

- 🐍 **Python Analysis**:
  - Used **Pandas** to clean and preprocess over **10,000+ flight records**
  - Performed **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify trends, missing values, and outliers
  - Visualized route trends, capacity utilization, and revenue patterns using **Matplotlib**

- 🧹 **Data Wrangling**:
  - Cleaned inconsistencies in departure/arrival data, passenger counts, and fare values
  - Merged multiple data sources using Python and SQL

- 🛠️ **SQL Optimization**:
  - Wrote **20+ queries** to extract metrics on occupancy rate, route performance, and profitability
  - Created reusable subqueries to support dashboard datasets

- 📊 **Power BI & Tableau Dashboards**:
  - Built dashboards that visualized:
    - High vs. low performing routes
    - Flight load over time
    - Revenue per flight segment
  - Used slicers and drill-down features to support data exploration for 6+ team members

- 📄 **Reporting & Insight Delivery**:
  - Identified revenue and capacity gaps that led to **20%+ efficiency improvements**
  - Highlighted seasonal demand shifts to improve **route planning by 25%**
